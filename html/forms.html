    <!--* The "form" element is just a container for form elements, but it could also contain other block elements -->
    <!--! A form shouldn't contain another form, same goes for the form elements -->

    <!--* "action" specifies where to send the form-data when it is submitted -->

    <!--* "method" specifies the HTTP method to use when sending the data -->
    <!--! The options are: GET and POST, it is optional, and the default is GET -->
    <form>
        <!--* The "name" attribute identifies the form data when sent, all form elements must include it -->

        <!--* "input" is the basic form element, the "type" attribute defines its purpose -->
        <!--! The default value is "text", if not specified -->

        <!--* "minlength" and "maxlength" specify the number of characters allowed when submitting the form -->
        <!--* "placeholder" displays a hint that describes the expected value, "value" sets a default value -->
        <input type="text" name="color">

        <!--* "textarea" is a multi-line field for text input -->
        <!--* You could use the "cols" and "rows" attributes to specify the size, but it's more common to use CSS -->
        <!--! It has a closing tag, and the text between the tags is the default value -->
        <textarea name="information"></textarea>

        <!--* Both the "disabled" and "readonly" attributes won't let you interact with the element -->
        <!--! But "disabled" won't send the data when submitting the form -->
        <input name="disabled" value="disabled" disabled>
        <input name="readonly" value="readonly" readonly>
