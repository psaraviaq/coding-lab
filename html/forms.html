<body>
    <!--* The "form" element is just a container for form elements, but it could also contain other block elements -->
    <!--! A form shouldn't contain another form, same goes for the form elements -->

    <!--* "action" specifies where to send the form-data when it is submitted -->
    <!--* "method" specifies the HTTP method to use when sending the data -->
    <!--! The options are: GET and POST, it is optional, and the default is GET -->
    <form>
        <!--* "input" is the basic form element, the "type" attribute defines its purpose -->
        <!--! The default value is "text", if not specified -->

        <!--* The "name" attribute identifies the form data when sent, most of the time it is required -->
        <!--* "minlength" and "maxlength" specify the number of characters allowed when submitting the form -->
        <!--* "placeholder" displays a hint that describes the expected value, "value" sets a default value -->
        <input type="text" name="animal">

        <!--^ Additional input types -->
        <!--* "password" hides the text, but it doesn't encrypt it when the form is submitted -->
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Your password">
        <!--* "email" is for email addresses, it has built-in validation -->
        <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">
        <!--TODO "search", "tel", "url" are mostly used for semantic reasons, they provide different keyboard layouts -->

        <!--* "submit" sends the form data to the server -->
        <input type="submit">
        <!--* "reset" returns the form to its initial state -->
        <input type="reset">
        <!--! You can customize their content with "value", and they don't require a "name" attribute -->

        <!--* With the type "button", you can define your own function with JavaScript, it has no default behavior -->
        <input type="button" value="Input button">
        <!--* But there's also a "button" element, which is more flexible -->
        <!--* It can even contain other elements like images, and have the "type" attribute set to "submit" or "reset" -->
        <!--! By default, it acts like a submit button -->
        <button>Default button</button>

        <!--* "datalist" displays a list of suggestions for an input field -->
        <!--* To link them, match the "list" attribute of the input with the "id" attribute of the datalist -->
        <!--! It is not supported in all browsers, as a fallback it will be a normal text input -->
        <input name="datalist" list="my_list">
        <datalist id="my_list">
            <!--* Inside the datalist, use "option" elements to define the suggestions with the "value" attribute -->
            <option value="apple">
            <option value="banana">
            <option value="orange">
        </datalist>

        <!--* "textarea" is a multi-line field for text input -->
        <!--* You could use the "cols" and "rows" attributes to specify the size, but it's more common to use CSS -->
        <!--! It has a closing tag, and the text between the tags is the default value -->
        <textarea name="information"></textarea>

        <!--* Both the "disabled" and "readonly" attributes won't let you interact with the element -->
        <!--! But "disabled" won't send the data when submitting the form -->
        <input name="disabled" value="disabled" disabled>
        <input name="readonly" value="readonly" readonly>
    </form>
